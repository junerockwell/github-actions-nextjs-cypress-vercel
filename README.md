# github-actions-nextjs-cypress-vercel

This project is a reference for me in putting together a NextJS app with Cypress E2E tests and deployed to Vercel.com using GitHub Actions.

This project does not demonstrate a NextJS focus.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Run Cypress E2E Tests (WIP)

```bash
npm run e2e
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
